Week 2 Homework Assignment

## Description
For this homework assignment we had to start building our portfolio. 

The two core technologies I used to build this portfolio was HTML and CSS. I had to start by forming my HTML page from stratch and then design it with the CSS after. In this project I used things like Sections, Classes, and IDs in my HTML and in CSS page some things I created was the font style, color of boarders, and size of the Images.
